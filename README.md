# Python-Assistant
My goal was to create a voice-to-text program and work with 
speech-recognition Python module. After writing the voice-to-text program,
I thought why not make a simple assistant out of this program. I hope I have helped you as much as I have.
This program is a simple app. Despite the simplicity of working with Python's voice recognition module, it shows.
This program does not use any paid services. It should be noted that using it is not a problem.
